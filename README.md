# 🌱 Web Dev Practice

A learning playground for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Three.js, and future coding projects.

----------

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is my personal coding sandbox — a place to practice and grow my skills in:

- HTML + CSS + JavaScript for front end and back end development

- Three.js + WebGL + React/React Three Fiber (via the Three.js Journey course)

- Foundation of Computer Science + Basic Game Script via Python

- Scripts and notes from learning Strudel.cc Live Editing 

- Java & C++ (future learning goals)

The folder structure includes lesson scripts, experiments, notes, and hands-on exercises from my courses.

This repo represents my long-term progression toward becoming a stronger computational chemist, creative developer, and technical designer.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
This project was created to practice web development in addition to:
- document progress publicly
- build foundational coding skills for
    - science computing
    - C++ development
    - Computational chemistry software 
- Showcase documented learning for mentors, collaborators, and research groups 

Long-term aim is to combine 3D visualization, interactive design, and quantum chemistry into educational tools and scientific animations.
